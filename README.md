# BrainView

## Getting started

### Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/youda97/BrainView.git
cd BrainView
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs on port `4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
